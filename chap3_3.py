# Assign a string value to the variable `x`

# Assign `x` to another variable `y`
# `y` now refers to the same object as `x`

# Check if `x` and `y` reference the same object in memory

# Assign a new string value to `y`
# This creates a new object and `y` now refers to a different memory location

# Check again if `x` and `y` reference the same object in memory
