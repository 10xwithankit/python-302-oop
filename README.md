# **PYTHON - 302: Mastering Object-Oriented Programming for AI and Data Science**

Welcome to **PYTHON - 302**, a course designed to help **AI engineers** and **data science professionals** master **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** in Python. This repository contains all the materials, hands-on exercises, and examples you need to integrate OOP principles into real-world AI and data science workflows.

---

## **Course Overview**
This course bridges the gap between Python programming, OOP concepts, and practical applications in AI and data science. Learn how to structure code for machine learning pipelines, data engineering tasks, and advanced AI models.

### **Key Learning Objectives**
- Understand core OOP principles: **Classes**, **Objects**, **Encapsulation**, **Inheritance**, and **Polymorphism**.
- Apply OOP concepts to **AI workflows**, such as model training, evaluation, and deployment.
- Build modular and scalable **data analysis pipelines** using `pandas` and OOP.
- Enhance ML models and **data engineering tasks** with clean, reusable code.
