# Define a class `Engine`

# Define a method `start_engine`
# This method prints a message indicating the engine has started

# Define a class `Wheels`

# Define a method `move_wheels`
# This method prints a message indicating the wheels are moving

# Define a class `Car` that inherits from both `Engine` and `Wheels`
# This is an example of multiple inheritance

# Create an instance of the `Car` class

# Call the `start_engine` method inherited from `Engine`

# Call the `move_wheels` method inherited from `Wheels`
