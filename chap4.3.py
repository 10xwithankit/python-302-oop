# Define a class `SuperHero`

# Define the constructor method (__init__)
# This method initializes the attributes of the superhero
# The `origin` parameter has a default value of "Unknown"

# Assign the `name` parameter to the instance variable `self.name`

# Assign the `superpower` parameter to the instance variable `self.superpower`

# Assign the `origin` parameter to the instance variable `self.origin`
# If no origin is provided, it defaults to "Unknown"

# Create an instance of the `SuperHero` class with only two arguments
# `hero1` represents Batman, and since no origin is provided, it defaults to "Unknown"

# Create another instance of the `SuperHero` class with all three arguments
# `hero2` represents Aquaman, with "Atlantis" as the specified origin

# Print the `origin` of `hero1`
# Since no origin was provided, it defaults to "Unknown"

# Print the `origin` of `hero2`
# The origin was explicitly set to "Atlantis"
