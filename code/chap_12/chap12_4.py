# Import `BaseModel`, `EmailStr`, and `field_validator` from the Pydantic library

# Define a class `User` that inherits from `BaseModel`
# This class represents a user with validation rules

# Define attributes with type annotations

# Define a field validator for the `age` field
# This method ensures that the user's age is at least 18

# Raise an error if age is below 18

# Return the valid age

# Create an instance of `User` with valid data

# Print the validated user object to ensure output is displayed
