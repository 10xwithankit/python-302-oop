# Import `BaseModel`, `validator`, and `EmailStr` from the Pydantic library

# Define a class `User` that inherits from `BaseModel`
# This class represents a user with validation rules

# Define attributes with type annotations

# Define a validator for the `age` field
# This method ensures that the user's age is at least 18

# Raise an error if age is below 18

# Return the valid age
