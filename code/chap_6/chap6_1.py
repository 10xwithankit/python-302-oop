# Define a parent class `Vehicle`

# Define the constructor method (__init__)
# This method initializes the vehicle's attributes

# Assign the `brand` parameter to the instance variable `self.brand`

# Assign the `speed` parameter to the instance variable `self.speed`

# Define a method `move`
# This method prints the movement details of the vehicle

# Define a child class `Car` that inherits from `Vehicle`
# Since it does not define any new methods or attributes, it inherits everything from `Vehicle`

# Define another child class `Bicycle` that also inherits from `Vehicle`

# Create an instance of the `Car` class
# This object inherits properties from `Vehicle`

# Create an instance of the `Bicycle` class
# This object also inherits properties from `Vehicle`

# Call the `move` method for the car object

# Call the `move` method for the bike object
