# Import the ABC module to define an abstract class

# Define an abstract class `DataSource`
# Abstract classes cannot be instantiated and must be inherited by subclasses

# Define an abstract method `read_data`
# This method must be implemented by any subclass

# Define a subclass `CSVSource` that inherits from `DataSource`

# Implement the `read_data` method
# This method prints a message indicating data is being read from a CSV file

# Define another subclass `SQLSource` that inherits from `DataSource`

# Implement the `read_data` method
# This method prints a message indicating data is being read from an SQL database

# Create instances of `CSVSource` and `SQLSource`

# Call the `read_data` method for `CSVSource` and `SQLSource`
