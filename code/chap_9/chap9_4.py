# Define an abstract class `DataCleaner`
# Abstract classes cannot be instantiated and must be inherited by subclasses
# Define an abstract method `clean_data`
# This method must be implemented by any subclass

# Define a subclass `MissingValueCleaner` that inherits from `DataCleaner`

# Implement the `clean_data` method
# This method prints a message for handling missing values

# Create an instance of `MissingValueCleaner`

# Call the `clean_data` method for `MissingValueCleaner`
