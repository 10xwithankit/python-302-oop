# Define a class `BankAccount`

# Define the constructor method (__init__)
# This method initializes the bank account balance

# Define a method `withdraw`
# This method allows withdrawing money while handling errors

# Check if the withdrawal amount exceeds the available balance
# Raise an exception if insufficient funds

# Deduct the amount from the balance
# Return the updated balance

# Gracefully handle the error and print an error message

# Create an instance of `BankAccount` with an initial balance of 100

# Attempt to withdraw 50 (successful transaction)

# Attempt to withdraw 200 (insufficient funds)
