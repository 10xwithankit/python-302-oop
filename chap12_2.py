# Import `BaseModel` and `ValidationError` from the Pydantic library

# Define a class `User` that inherits from `BaseModel`
# Pydantic's `BaseModel` is used for data validation and modeling

# Define attributes with type annotations

# Use a try-except block to handle validation errors

# Attempt to create an instance of `User` with incorrect data types

# Catch and print the validation error in JSON format
